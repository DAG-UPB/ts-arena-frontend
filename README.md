# TS-Arena Frontend

## Concept

TS-Arena is a platform designed for **pre-registered forecasts into the real future**. This approach ensures rigorous, information leakage-free evaluations by comparing model predictions against data that did not exist at the time of the forecast.

This repository contains the backend infrastructure that powers the TS-Arena platform. It is designed to be self-hostable, allowing you to run your own instance of the benchmarking environment.
